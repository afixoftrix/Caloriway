# Caloriway

***This is a project meant for Chingu Voyage 11 pre-cohort.***

Caloriway is supposed to be an app that finds the
amount of calories along a given path. The user enter a start point and end point, then the
app calculate calories based on how many restuarants
and type of food served at those restaurants. Right
now it just shows you 5 restaurants in the
Portsmouth area of Virginia. #help

## Installation

This app is built from the `create-react-app` tool.

To install the app simply clone the app into a local directory.
This can be achieved using the git command 

`git clone <Path/to/repo>`

There should be a "clone button" that will let you copy the path if you are viewing this project on github.

When the app has been cloned, run 

`yarn install`

After installation, run

`yarn start`

For testing, run

`yarn test`

## Storybook

I started out using this project as a way to learn storybook. I did some learning but it took a toll on the allotted completion time. Will continue playing with it and component testing after project submission.

## Issues

I'm getting an error from the react-helmet package. 
I also didn't refine the api query as regards to adding limits to search result. I found reading the mapbox api rather tedious and was more focused on reaching the dead line.
